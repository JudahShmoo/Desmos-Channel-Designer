# Channel Designer

## Description:
Channel Designer is a web application I made to help with the design of open channels. It allows you to create channels by manipulating a default channel shape, and then it calculates the properties of the channel such as hydraulic radius, velocity, and flow rate.

## Where to find it:
I built it using the Desmos API, which allows for dynamic graphing and calculations. It is available as a web app at [channel-designer.judottech.com.au](https://channel-designer.judottech.com.au).

## Features:

### Channel Type

Channel Designer allows you to choose from different channel types such as roadway, kerb and channel, swale, trapezoidal and composite. Each channel type has its own default shape and its own number of points.

### Draggable Points
You can drag the points of the channel shape to create your own custom channel while still being able to enter specific values.

### Print Functionality
I have included print functionality so you can export the channel design as a PDF.

### Project Name + Number
You can enter a project name and number, which will be included in the printout.

### Saving and loading
You can save your channel designs to your file explorer and load them later.
